\# Sample Datasets



This folder contains small sample datasets provided for reproducibility and

demonstration purposes.



\## Folder Structure



\- `optimal/`  

&nbsp; Datasets generated using optimal pilot assignment, computed via exhaustive

&nbsp; search to minimize NMSE.



\- `random/`  

&nbsp; Datasets generated using random pilot assignment, used as a baseline reference.



Each dataset name indicates the configuration used during generation:



* users{N}\_antennas{M}.csv

where:

\- `N` is the number of user equipments (UEs)

\- `M` is the number of base station antennas



\## Notes on Scalability



Dataset generation time increases combinatorially with the number of users and

pilot sequences. Larger datasets were generated offline and are not included

due to computational and size constraints.
